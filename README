New Cloudproxy Crypto Project
=============================


This code was written for educational purposes and to experiment with some of
Google's public source code, mainly protobuf, gtest and gflags.  It may also
be incorporated into Cloudproxy at some point after I do more testing but
maybe not.

This is a work in progress, I plan some improvements and additions (see the "todo"
file in ROOT/new).

   Yes, this means that you, your company, your club, and anyone else
   can use this code anywhere you want. You can change it and distribute it
   under the GPL, include it in your commercial product without releasing
   the source code, put it on the web, etc.


Timing attacks
--------------

  This code is not meant to be resistant to timing attacks.  In fact,
  it is extremely not timing attack resistant.  To make resistant requires 
  changing all the calculations be fixed length and "if-free" in (at a minumum) 
  intel64_arith.cc and in the function ModExp and in number_theory.cc.  So my advice
  in not to use it for on-line encryption/decryption without extensive changes.

How to build
------------

  The command buildall in the root directory builds all the code once you set up
  directories for the object files and binaries.  I put binaries in ~/cryptobin and
  object files in ~/cryptoobj (in several subdirectories).  Most of the executables
  buildall builds are tests; however, there is a command line utility called cryptutil.

  You need a c-11 compiler with the standard libraries, protobuf, gtest and gflags all
  of which are available in open source.  Currently, the code is Intel64 only (the
  assembly assist assumes Intel64 and RNG and aes use Ivy Bridge and later instructions
  fore aesni and RNG.

Feedback
--------

  I welcome corrections and suggestions.  Please do not send material that you are not
  authorized to send.  All feedback will be treated as licensed under the same terms
  as this code; so don't send any information or feedback that you cannot or do
  not wish to license under those terms.
